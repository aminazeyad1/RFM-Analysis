This project focuses on segmenting customers to optimize marketing strategies and improve business performance. It utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis to measure customer value based on three key dimensions:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase.
Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase.
Monetary (M): How much money a customer spends.
By calculating RFM scores for each customer, the dataset is enriched with valuable insights into customer behavior patterns. K-Means clustering, a machine learning algorithm, is then applied to group customers into distinct segments based on their RFM scores.

Key Steps in the Project:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
RFM Score Calculation: Deriving Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer.
K-Means Clustering: Identifying optimal clusters using methods like the Elbow method.
Customer Profiling: Analyzing and interpreting clusters to create meaningful customer personas, such as "Diamond" "Gold," or "Silver."
Visualization: Creating intuitive plots and dashboards to present findings, such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and cluster distribution charts.
Outcome:
The project delivers actionable insights into customer behavior, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, design targeted campaigns, and prioritize customer retention efforts effectively.
